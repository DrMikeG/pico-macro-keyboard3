Going to try with an arduino nano now.

Maybe the boards are bad.

Installed arduino ide
plugged into nano, appeared as com 3.
Compiled example, but cannot get it to upload.
Changed bootload to ATmegaATP3 (old boot loader)


Change to an uno.

Using example

PICC type: MIFARE Ultralight or Ultralight C
Your tag is not of type MIFARE Classic.
PICC type: MIFARE Ultralight or Ultralight C
Your tag is not of type MIFARE Classic.
PICC type: MIFARE Ultralight or Ultralight C
Your tag is not of type MIFARE Classic.

PICC type: MIFARE 1KB
A new card has been detected.
The NUID tag is:
In hex:  79 1C 50 D3
In dec:  121 28 80 211


Now I know that this board works when weird to an arduino, I feel reassured to go back to test one with the pi pico in code 07.
