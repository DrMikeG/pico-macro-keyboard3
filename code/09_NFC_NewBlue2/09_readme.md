# Different library

I'm still trying to get the MFRC522 boards to work under circuit python.

All the repos seems to actully be built on the same port - so trying this again:

https://gitlab.com/christopher_m/circuitpython-mfrc522/-/tree/master?ref_type=heads

And with some success.

I can read a card and a fob, but not a ring, using the big blue board and the pi pico.

I hope this is a software issue.
